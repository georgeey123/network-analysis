## Overview
This project explores character co-occurrence networks in the "Game of Thrones" book series, analyzing the evolution of character importance across the books. The analysis is based on Network Science concepts and implemented using Python and NetworkX.

## Project Description
The project focuses on network analysis in the context of a well-known book series. The primary objectives include:

- Building character interaction networks for each book.
- Calculating various centrality measures to assess character importance.
- Comparing character importance rankings across different measures and books.
- Visualizing the results to understand the evolution of character importance.

The analysis covers five books in the series and showcases the application of network analysis techniques.
